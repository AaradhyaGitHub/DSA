## PART 3: SESSION HISTORY (BRIEF SUMMARIES)

**Sessions 1-2 (Oct 15-16):** Time complexity basics — O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²), O(n log n). Intuitive understanding via doubling principle. MASTERED.

**Sessions 3-4 (Oct 17-18):** Recursion — Tree visualization, base case analysis, "trust the recursion" mindset. Design problems 90-95% correct logic. MASTERED.

**Sessions 5-7 (Oct 19-21):** Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues — OOP basics, node structure, traversal, two-pointer patterns. Breakthrough: Recognized fear response to OOP syntax, overrode it. MASTERED.

**Sessions 8-12 (Oct 22-28):** Trees & BST — BST properties, insert/delete/search, traversals, tree problems. Session 12 crash: 22-hour Pigeonhole tangent. MASTERED.

**Session 13 (Oct 29):** Hash Tables — 3 core patterns: existence check, frequency counting, complement finding. Solved 7/7 problems. Pattern recognition 100%. MASTERED.

**Sessions 14-15 (Oct 30-31):** Graphs — Adjacency list, DFS (100% tracing), BFS (100% tracing), algorithm selection. Problems: Connected components, islands, paths, cycles. Spider web analogy clicked. MASTERED.

**Session 16 (Nov 2-4):** Sorting — Bubble, Selection, Insertion (100% mastery), Merge, Quick (100% conceptual, 80% implementation). 13-14 hours across 3 days. Haunted Treasure Hunt analogy. MASTERED.

**Session 17 (Nov 6-8):** Time Complexity Deep — Formal Big O analysis, Gauss summation applied to Bubble Sort, recursive complexity. 34 hours total across 4 attempts. Created zipper analogy for recursion. 80% confidence. MASTERED.

**Session 18 (Nov 9-10):** Space Complexity — TIME vs SPACE distinction (critical breakthrough), Python syntax that creates memory, sorting algorithms space analysis, recursion stack space, space-time tradeoffs. 10 practice problems (80% accuracy). Self-assessed 80% confidence. Felt "chore-ish" as last session before review. MASTERED.
